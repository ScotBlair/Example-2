<br />- Assignment and Communication<br />
John Doe in Support answers the phone and establishes communication with Dave.  Dave explains that he needs to have his account unlocked and his password reset.  John creates a ticket for Dave and files it under the "Password Reset" help topic.<br />

<br />- Working the Issue<br />
John opens up Active Directory on his pc, goes to _EMPLOYEES --> _ACCOUNTANTS in the left panel, right-clicks on Dave's name, and then selects "Reset Password."  In the pop-up window, he gives Dave a temporary password to use, then selects "User must change password at next logon" and "Unlock the user's account."<br />
