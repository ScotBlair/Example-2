- Assignment and Communication<br />
John Doe in Support answers the phone and establishes communication with Dave.  Dave explains that he needs to have his account unlocked and his password reset.  John creates a ticket for Dave and files it under the "Password Reset" help topic.

- Working the Issue<br />
John opens up Active Directory on his pc, goes to _EMPLOYEES --> _ACCOUNTANTS in the left panel, right-clicks on Dave's name, and then selects "Reset Password."  In the pop-up window, he gives Dave a temporary password to use, then selects "User must change password at next logon" and "Unlock the user's account."

- Resolution<br />
John calls Dave back up and tells him that his account has been unlocked and gives him the temporary password to logon.  He finishes resolving the support ticket by filling out the information, then closes the ticket.
